The game almost feels too hard since the player paddle is somewhat small and the balls move very quickly.

It would feel easier if the balls were slower and the paddle was bigger. The inverse applies for harder.

I think a good wow factor would be some music and effects during gameplay as well as hazards.

I think the blocking balls part is fun. It can be tedious trying to get it lined up for blocking.
